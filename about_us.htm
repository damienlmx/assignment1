<p class="para" >East Coast Park is one of Singapore's most treasured urban getaways, offering a exciting diversity of recreational, sporting and dining activities. 
    With the theme “Recreation for All”, the park has an activity for everyone.
</p>
<p class="para" > It is a beach and a park encompassing Marine Parade, Bedok and Tampines, along the southeastern coast of Singapore. 
    It was opened in the 1970s, after the Singapore government had completed reclaiming land off the coast at Katong which extends from Changi to Kallang. It serves these and other seaside communities.
</p>
    
<p class="para" > East Coast Park is the largest park in Singapore, and is built entirely on reclaimed land with a man-made beach, where swimming is possible. The beach is protected by breakwaters.
</p>


<p class="para" >It has barbecue pits, chalets, food centres and amenities for various sports activities. Visitors can fish at Bedok Jetty (Area F). A cycling and inline skating track runs along the perimeter of the park, which measures over 15 km (9.3 mi) long. 
It is connected to Changi Beach Park by the Coastal Park Connector Network, a 12 km (7.5 mi) park connector running along Tanah Merah Coast Road.</p>
